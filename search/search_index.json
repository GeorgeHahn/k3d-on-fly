Example: you want to enable the EphemeralContainers feature flag in Kubernetes Solution: k3d cluster create --k3s-server-arg '--kube-apiserver-arg=feature-gates=EphemeralContainers=true' Note : Be aware of where the flags require dashes ( -- ) and where not. the k3s flag ( --kube-apiserver-arg ) has the dashes the kube-apiserver flag feature-gates doesn\u2019t have them (k3s adds them internally) Second example: k3d cluster create k3d-one \\ --k3s-server-arg --cluster-cidr = \"10.118.0.0/17\" \\ --k3s-server-arg --service-cidr = \"10.118.128.0/17\" \\ --k3s-server-arg --disable = servicelb \\ --k3s-server-arg --disable = traefik \\ --verbose Note : There are many ways to use the \" and ' quotes, just be aware, that sometimes shells also try to interpret/interpolate parts of the commands How to access services (like a database) running on my Docker Host Machine \u00b6 As of version v3.1.0, we\u2019re injecting the host.k3d.internal entry into the k3d containers (k3s nodes) and into the CoreDNS ConfigMap, enabling you to access your host system by referring to it as host.k3d.internal Running behind a corporate proxy \u00b6 Running k3d behind a corporate proxy can lead to some issues with k3d that have already been reported in more than one issue. Some can be fixed by passing the HTTP_PROXY environment variables to k3d, some have to be fixed in docker\u2019s daemon.json file and some are as easy as adding a volume mount.

[SOLVED] Nodes fail to start or get stuck in NotReady state with log nf_conntrack_max: permission denied \u00b6 Problem \u00b6 When: This happens when running k3d on a Linux system with a kernel version >= 5.12.2 (and others like >= 5.11.19) when creating a new cluster the node(s) stop or get stuck with a log line like this: <TIMESTAMP> F0516 05:05:31.782902 7 server.go:495] open /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max: permission denied Why: The issue was introduced by a change in the Linux kernel ( Changelog 5.12.2 : Commit ), that changed the netfilter_conntrack behavior in a way that kube-proxy is not able to set the nf_conntrack_max value anymore Workaround \u00b6 Workaround: as a workaround, we can tell kube-proxy to not even try to set this value: k3d cluster create \\ --k3s-server-arg \"--kube-proxy-arg=conntrack-max-per-core=0\" \\ --k3s-agent-arg \"--kube-proxy-arg=conntrack-max-per-core=0\" \\ --image rancher/k3s:v1.20.6-k3s Fix \u00b6 Note : k3d v4.4.5 already uses rancher/k3s:v1.21.1-k3s1 as the new default k3s image, so no workarounds needed there! This is going to be fixed \u201cupstream\u201d in k3s itself in rancher/k3s#3337 and backported to k3s versions as low as v1.18. The fix was released and backported in k3s, so you don\u2019t need to use the workaround when using one of the following k3s versions (or later ones) v1.18.19-k3s1 ( rancher/k3s#3344 ) v1.19.11-k3s1 ( rancher/k3s#3343 ) v1.20.7-k3s1 ( rancher/k3s#3342 ) v1.21.1-k3s1 ( rancher/k3s#3341 )) Issue Reference: rancher/k3s#607 DockerHub Pull Rate Limit \u00b6 Problem \u00b6 You\u2019re deploying something to the cluster using an image from DockerHub and the image fails to be pulled, with a 429 response code and a message saying You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading . Cause \u00b6 This is caused by DockerHub\u2019s pull rate limit (see https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/ ), which limits pulls from unauthenticated/anonymous users to 100 pulls per hour and for authenticated users (not paying customers) to 200 pulls per hour (as of the time of writing). Solution \u00b6 a) use images from a private registry, e.g. configured as a pull-through cache for DockerHub b) use a different public registry without such limitations, if the same image is stored there c) authenticate containerd inside k3s/k3d to use your DockerHub user (c) Authenticate Containerd against DockerHub \u00b6 Create a registry configuration file for containerd: # saved as e.g. $HOME/registries.yaml configs : \"docker.io\" : auth : username : \"$USERNAME\" password : \"$PASSWORD\" Create a k3d cluster using that config: k3d cluster create --registry-config $HOME /registries.yaml Profit.

This allows you to define all the things that you defined with CLI flags before in a nice and tidy YAML (as a Kubernetes user, we know you love it ;) ). Syntax & Semantics The options defined in the config file are not 100% the same as the CLI flags. This concerns naming and style/usage/structure, e.g. --api-port is split up into a field named kubeAPI that has 3 different \u201cchild fields\u201d ( host , hostIP and hostPort ) k3d options are bundled in a scope named options.k3d , where --no-rollback is defined as options.k3d.disableRollback repeatable flags (like --port ) are reflected as YAML lists Usage \u00b6 Using a config file is as easy as putting it in a well-known place in your file system and then referencing it via flag: All options in config file: k3d cluster create --config /home/me/my-awesome-config.yaml (must be .yaml / .yml ) With CLI override (name): k3d cluster create somename --config /home/me/my-awesome-config.yaml With CLI override (extra volume): k3d cluster create --config /home/me/my-awesome-config.yaml --volume '/some/path:/some:path@server[0]' Required Fields \u00b6 As of the time of writing this documentation, the config file only requires you to define two fields: apiVersion to match the version of the config file that you want to use (at this time it would be apiVersion: k3d.io/v1alpha2 ) kind to define the kind of config file that you want to use (currently we only have the Simple config) So this would be the minimal config file, which configures absolutely nothing: apiVersion : k3d.io/v1alpha2 kind : Simple Config Options \u00b6 The configuration options for k3d are continuously evolving and so is the config file (syntax) itself. Currently, the config file is still in an Alpha-State, meaning, that it is subject to change anytime (though we try to keep breaking changes low). Validation via JSON-Schema k3d uses a JSON-Schema to describe the expected format and fields of the configuration file. This schema is also used to validate a user-given config file. This JSON-Schema can be found in the specific config version sub-directory in the repository (e.g. here for v1alpha2 ) and could be used to lookup supported fields or by linters to validate the config file, e.g. in your code editor. All Options: Example \u00b6 Since the config options and the config file are changing quite a bit, it\u2019s hard to keep track of all the supported config file settings, so here\u2019s an example showing all of them as of the time of writing: # k3d configuration file, saved as e.g. /home/me/myk3dcluster.yaml apiVersion : k3d.io/v1alpha2 # this will change in the future as we make everything more stable kind : Simple # internally, we also have a Cluster config, which is not yet available externally name : mycluster # name that you want to give to your cluster (will still be prefixed with `k3d-`) servers : 1 # same as `--servers 1` agents : 2 # same as `--agents 2` kubeAPI : # same as `--api-port myhost.my.domain:6445` (where the name would resolve to 127.0.0.1) host : \"myhost.my.domain\" # important for the `server` setting in the kubeconfig hostIP : \"127.0.0.1\" # where the Kubernetes API will be listening on hostPort : \"6445\" # where the Kubernetes API listening port will be mapped to on your host system image : rancher/k3s:v1.20.4-k3s1 # same as `--image rancher/k3s:v1.20.4-k3s1` network : my-custom-net # same as `--network my-custom-net` token : superSecretToken # same as `--token superSecretToken` volumes : # repeatable flags are represented as YAML lists - volume : /my/host/path:/path/in/node # same as `--volume '/my/host/path:/path/in/node@server[0];agent[*]'` nodeFilters : - server[0] - agent[*] ports : - port : 8080:80 # same as `--port '8080:80@loadbalancer'` nodeFilters : - loadbalancer labels : - label : foo=bar # same as `--label 'foo=bar@agent[1]'` nodeFilters : - agent[1] env : - envVar : bar=baz # same as `--env 'bar=baz@server[0]'` nodeFilters : - server[0] registries : # define how registries should be created or used create : true # creates a default registry to be used with the cluster; same as `--registry-create` use : - k3d-myotherregistry:5000 # some other k3d-managed registry; same as `--registry-use 'k3d-myotherregistry:5000'` config : | # define contents of the `registries.yaml` file (or reference a file); same as `--registry-config /path/to/config.yaml` mirrors: \"my.company.registry\": endpoint: - http://my.company.registry:5000 options : k3d : # k3d runtime settings wait : true # wait for cluster to be usable before returining; same as `--wait` (default: true) timeout : \"60s\" # wait timeout before aborting; same as `--timeout 60s` disableLoadbalancer : false # same as `--no-lb` disableImageVolume : false # same as `--no-image-volume` disableRollback : false # same as `--no-Rollback` disableHostIPInjection : false # same as `--no-hostip` k3s : # options passed on to K3s itself extraServerArgs : # additional arguments passed to the `k3s server` command; same as `--k3s-server-arg` - --tls-san=my.host.domain extraAgentArgs : [] # addditional arguments passed to the `k3s agent` command; same as `--k3s-agent-arg` kubeconfig : updateDefaultKubeconfig : true # add new cluster to your default Kubeconfig; same as `--kubeconfig-update-default` (default: true) switchCurrentContext : true # also set current-context to the new cluster's context; same as `--kubeconfig-switch-context` (default: true) runtime : # runtime (docker) specific options gpuRequest : all # same as `--gpus all` Config File vs. CLI Flags \u00b6 k3d uses Cobra and Viper for CLI and general config handling respectively. This automatically introduces a \u201cconfig option order of priority\u201d ( precedence order ): Config Precedence Order Source: spf13/viper#why-viper Internal Setting > CLI Flag > Environment Variable > Config File > (k/v store >) Defaults This means, that you can define e.g. a \u201cbase configuration file\u201d with settings that you share across different clusters and override only the fields that differ between those clusters in your CLI flags/arguments. For example, you use the same config file to create three clusters which only have different names and kubeAPI ( --api-port ) settings.

In that case, you can apply it manually via kubectl apply -f device-plugin-daemonset.yaml . Known issues \u00b6 This approach does not work on WSL2 yet.

Note well there is an important limitation: this configuration file will only work with k3s >= v0.10.0 . It will fail silently with previous versions of k3s, but you find in the section below an alternative solution. This file can also be used for providing additional information necessary for accessing some registries, like authentication and certificates . Registries Configuration File embedded in k3d\u2019s SimpleConfig \u00b6 If you\u2019re using a SimpleConfig file to configure your k3d cluster, you may as well embed the registries.yaml in there directly: apiVersion : k3d.io/v1alpha2 kind : Simple name : test servers : 1 agents : 2 registries : create : true config : | mirrors: \"my.company.registry\": endpoint: - http://my.company.registry:5000 Here, the config for the k3d-managed registry, created by the create: true flag will be merged with the config specified under config: | . Authenticated registries \u00b6 When using authenticated registries, we can add the username and password in a configs section in the registries.yaml , like this: mirrors : my.company.registry : endpoint : - http://my.company.registry configs : my.company.registry : auth : username : aladin password : abracadabra Secure registries \u00b6 When using secure registries, the registries.yaml file must include information about the certificates. For example, if you want to use images from the secure registry running at https://my.company.registry , you must first download a CA file valid for that server and store it in some well-known directory like ${HOME}/.k3d/my-company-root.pem . Then you have to mount the CA file in some directory in the nodes in the cluster and include that mounted file in a configs section in the registries.yaml file . For example, if we mount the CA file in /etc/ssl/certs/my-company-root.pem , the registries.yaml will look like: mirrors : my.company.registry : endpoint : - https://my.company.registry configs : my.company.registry : tls : # we will mount \"my-company-root.pem\" in the /etc/ssl/certs/ directory. ca_file : \"/etc/ssl/certs/my-company-root.pem\" Finally, we can create the cluster, mounting the CA file in the path we specified in ca_file : k3d cluster create \\ --volume \" ${ HOME } /.k3d/my-registries.yaml:/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml\" \\ --volume \" ${ HOME } /.k3d/my-company-root.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/my-company-root.pem\" Using a local registry \u00b6 Using k3d-managed registries \u00b6 Just ported! The k3d-managed registry is available again as of k3d v4.0.0 (January 2021) Create a dedicated registry together with your cluster \u00b6 k3d cluster create mycluster --registry-create : This creates your cluster mycluster together with a registry container called k3d-mycluster-registry k3d sets everything up in the cluster for containerd to be able to pull images from that registry (using the registries.yaml file) the port, which the registry is listening on will be mapped to a random port on your host system Check the k3d command output or docker ps -f name = k3d-mycluster-registry to find the exposed port (let\u2019s use 12345 here) Pull some image (optional) docker pull alpine:latest , re-tag it to reference your newly created registry docker tag alpine:latest k3d-mycluster-registry:12345/testimage:local and push it docker push k3d-mycluster-registry:12345/testimage:local Use kubectl to create a new pod in your cluster using that image to see, if the cluster can pull from the new registry: kubectl run --image k3d-mycluster-registry:12345/testimage:local testimage --command -- tail -f /dev/null (creates a container that will not do anything but keep on running) Create a customized k3d-managed registry \u00b6 k3d registry create myregistry.localhost --port 12345 creates a new registry called k3d-myregistry.localhost (could be used with automatic resolution of *.localhost , see next section - also, note the k3d- prefix that k3d adds to all resources it creates) k3d cluster create newcluster --registry-use k3d-myregistry.localhost:12345 (make sure you use the k3d- prefix here) creates a new cluster set up to us that registry continue with step 3 and 4 from the last section for testing Using your own (not k3d-managed) local registry \u00b6 We recommend using a k3d-managed registry, as it plays nicely together with k3d clusters, but here\u2019s also a guide to create your own (not k3d-managed) registry, if you need features or customizations, that k3d does not provide: Using your own (not k3d-managed) local registry You can start your own local registry it with some docker commands, like: docker volume create local_registry docker container run -d --name registry.localhost -v local_registry:/var/lib/registry --restart always -p 5000 :5000 registry:2 These commands will start your registry in registry.localhost:5000 . In order to push to this registry, you will need to make it accessible as described in the next section. Once your registry is up and running, we will need to add it to your registries.yaml configuration file. Finally, you have to connect the registry network to the k3d cluster network: docker network connect k3d-k3s-default registry.localhost . And then you can test your local registry . Pushing to your local registry address \u00b6 As per the guide above, the registry will be available at registry.localhost:5000 . All the nodes in your k3d cluster can resolve this hostname (thanks to the DNS server provided by the Docker daemon) but, in order to be able to push to this registry, this hostname also has to be resolved by your host. nss-myhostname to resolve *.localhost Luckily (for Linux users), NSS-myhostname ships with many Linux distributions and should resolve *.localhost automatically to 127.0.0.1 . Otherwise, it\u2019s installable using sudo apt install libnss-myhostname . If your system does not provide/support tools that can auto-resolve specific names to 127.0.0.1 , you can manually add an entry in your /etc/hosts ( c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts on Windows) file like this: 127 .0.0.1 k3d-registry.localhost Once again, this will only work with k3s >= v0.10.0 (see the some sections below when using k3s <= v0.9.1) Testing your registry \u00b6 You should test that you can push to your registry from your local development machine. use images from that registry in Deployments in your k3d cluster. We will verify these two things for a local registry (located at k3d-registry.localhost:12345 ) running in your development machine. Things would be basically the same for checking an external registry, but some additional configuration could be necessary in your local machine when using an authenticated or secure registry (please refer to Docker\u2019s documentation for this). First, we can download some image (like nginx ) and push it to our local registry with: docker pull nginx:latest docker tag nginx:latest k3d-registry.localhost:5000/nginx:latest docker push k3d-registry.localhost:5000/nginx:latest Then we can deploy a pod referencing this image to your cluster: cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-test-registry labels: app: nginx-test-registry spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx-test-registry template: metadata: labels: app: nginx-test-registry spec: containers: - name: nginx-test-registry image: k3d-registry.localhost:12345/nginx:latest ports: - containerPort: 80 EOF Then you should check that the pod is running with kubectl get pods -l \"app=nginx-test-registry\" . Configuring registries for k3s <= v0.9.1 \u00b6 k3s servers below v0.9.1 do not recognize the registries.yaml file as described in the in the beginning, so you will need to embed the contents of that file in a containerd configuration file. You will have to create your own containerd configuration file at some well-known path like ${HOME}/.k3d/config.toml.tmpl , like this: config.toml.tmpl # Original section: no changes [plugins.opt] path = \"{{ .NodeConfig.Containerd.Opt }}\" [plugins.cri] stream_server_address = \"{{ .NodeConfig.AgentConfig.NodeName }}\" stream_server_port = \"10010\" {{ - if .
